It took me way too long to realize this. If you&rsquo;re feeling stuck, here&rsquo;s why.
A few years ago, I worked on a Generative AI project, a customer-facing AI assistant. The company had great data and was convinced AI could turn it into something valuable.
We built a prototype fast. Users were excited.
Iteration was quick. Each tweak made the AI feel better.

But suddenly, everything slowed down.\nSome changes made things better‚Äîbut we weren‚Äôt sure why. Other changes made things worse‚Äîbut we couldn‚Äôt explain how. Sometimes, things just felt‚Ä¶ different, not actually better. It took me way too long to realize: we weren‚Äôt iterating. We were guessing.\nWe were tweaking prompts, adjusting retrieval parameters, fine-tuning the model‚Ä¶ but none of it was measured. We were just testing on a few cherry-picked examples and convincing ourselves that it felt better.\nAnd that‚Äôs exactly how most AI teams get stuck.\nBetter on a Few Examples Isn‚Äôt Better When you‚Äôre close to a project, it‚Äôs easy to think you can tell when something improves. You run a few tests. The output looks better. So you assume progress.\nBut:\nDid it actually improve across the board? Did it break something else in the process? Are you fixing what users actually care about‚Äîor just what you noticed? Most teams think they‚Äôre iterating. They‚Äôre just moving.\nIteration Without Measurement Is Just Movement And that‚Äôs the real problem.\nMost teams, when they hit this wall, do what we did: try more things.\nMore prompt tweaks. More model adjustments. More retrieval fine-tuning. But without a way to measure progress, this isn‚Äôt iteration‚Äîit‚Äôs just motion.\nReal iteration isn‚Äôt about making changes. It‚Äôs about knowing, at every step, whether those changes actually work.\nWithout that, you‚Äôre just optimizing in the dark.\nSo What‚Äôs the Fix? The teams that move past this don‚Äôt just build better models‚Äîthey build better ways to measure what ‚Äúbetter‚Äù means.\nInstead of relying on gut feeling, they:\nDefine clear success criteria‚Äîwhat actually makes an answer useful? Measure changes systematically‚Äînot just on a few cherry-picked examples. Make sure improvements don‚Äôt break what already works. The Bottom Line Most AI teams don‚Äôt struggle to build AI. They struggle to improve it.\nI learned this the hard way. But once I started treating iteration as something that needs clear feedback loops, not gut feeling, everything changed.\nIf you‚Äôre stuck in the loop of ‚Äútweaking but not improving,‚Äù you‚Äôre not alone.
