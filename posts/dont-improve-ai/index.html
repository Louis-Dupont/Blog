Yet, adoption hasn’t moved. Frustrating? You’re not alone—this is a trap many AI teams fall into.\nThe problem isn’t that AI isn’t ready. It’s that the way we approach AI makes us feel productive while ignoring the real challenge: solving critical user needs.\nLet’s break down why this happens—and how you can escape the trap.\nWhy Metrics Make You Feel Safe—But Keep You Stuck AI metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall feel reassuring. They’re tangible. They give you a clear sense of progress.\nBut here’s the uncomfortable truth: metrics create the illusion of progress.\nTeams rely on metrics because they’re easier to measure than user success. A 5% boost in accuracy feels like a win—even if it doesn’t move the needle on user adoption.\nOne team I worked with spent months improving a model to handle nuanced queries. Accuracy jumped, but user engagement didn’t. Why? Users didn’t care about nuance—they wanted instant answers. When we pivoted to a simpler Q\u0026A database, adoption skyrocketed. The problem wasn’t the model. It was what we thought the model should solve.\nMetrics are a comfort zone. They distract from the harder, messier question: What do my users actually need?\nWhy “Listening to Feedback” Is a Dangerous Half-Truth Most teams think they’re user-focused because they collect feedback. They track adoption metrics. They tweak features based on what users ask for. But here’s the trap: listening to users isn’t the same as solving their problems.\nHere’s why:\nFeedback reflects what users think they want—not necessarily what they’ll use. Adoption metrics only show you the symptoms, not the causes. One team built a highly sophisticated recommendation system based on user requests. It worked beautifully—on paper. But users didn’t engage because it added complexity to a process they already found overwhelming.\nThe takeaway? User feedback is a starting point, not a roadmap. Solving user problems requires going beyond what they say to understand what they actually do.\nWhy Complexity Is Killing Your Adoption Rates More features, smarter models, and cutting-edge techniques don’t equal better solutions.\nThe more you refine your AI model, the more complex it becomes—making it harder for users to trust and adopt. This creates a vicious cycle:\nUsers struggle to engage. Teams assume the tool isn’t good enough. They add more features or refine the model further. Complexity increases, adoption stalls, and the cycle repeats. Here’s the cost of complexity:\nHarder to maintain and iterate on. Higher cognitive load for users. Increased risk of failure in real-world scenarios. To break the cycle, you need to focus on clarity and simplicity. Not because they’re easier, but because they’re harder to achieve—and far more valuable.\nHow to Stop Building Smarter Models and Start Solving Real Problems If your project feels stuck, it’s time to redefine what progress means. Progress isn’t about improving the tool—it’s about solving the user’s problem.\nHere’s how:\n1. Write Down What You Think Progress Looks Like Before making your next improvement, write down the following:\nWhat’s the specific user problem I’m solving? Does this change directly impact user outcomes? If I stopped improving the model today, could I still deliver value? If you’re answering “no” to any of these, step back. Refining the tool isn’t the solution.\n2. Replace Metrics With User Outcomes Metrics like accuracy and precision are helpful—but they’re supporting indicators, not success metrics. True progress comes from measurable user outcomes.\nFocus on:\nAdoption: Are users consistently engaging with the tool? Efficiency: Are tasks faster or easier for users? Satisfaction: Are users returning or recommending the tool? If your changes don’t improve these outcomes, they aren’t real progress.\n3. Simplify Like Your Users’ Success Depends On It Simplification isn’t a shortcut—it’s a strategy for delivering faster, more meaningful results.\nAsk yourself:\nWhat’s the simplest way to solve my users’ most critical problem? What features or complexities can I remove to increase clarity and trust? Simplifying doesn’t mean doing less—it means doing what matters most.\nThe Shift That Will Make or Break Your AI Project AI projects don’t fail because teams lack ambition or expertise. They fail because they mistake technical progress for success. Tutorials, metrics, and frameworks create momentum—but without a clear connection to user outcomes, they lead you in circles.\nBy focusing on user problems over technical improvements, you’ll stop building for the sake of the tool and start building for the people who use it.\nA New Definition of Progress Next time you’re tempted to tweak your model, ask yourself:\nAm I solving the right problem—or just improving the tool? What’s the simplest way to deliver value today? If I removed complexity, would it improve adoption? The best AI solutions aren’t the most advanced. They’re the ones users can’t imagine working without. Build for that.\nDoes this resonate with your AI journey? I’d love to hear your thoughts or challenges in the comments.\n","wordCount":"830","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-01-01T16:22:38+01:00","dateModified":"2025-01-01T16:22:38+01:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://louis-dupont.github.io/Blog/posts/dont-improve-ai/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Louis Dupont","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://louis-dupont.github.io/Blog/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://louis-dupont.github.io/Blog/ accesskey=h title="Louis Dupont (Alt + H)">Louis Dupont</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">📉 Why Improving Your AI Model Is Killing Your Project’s Success</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-01-01 16:22:38 +0100 +0100'>January 1, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#why-metrics-make-you-feel-safebut-keep-you-stuck aria-label="Why Metrics Make You Feel Safe—But Keep You Stuck">Why Metrics Make You Feel Safe—But Keep You Stuck</a></li><li><a href=#why-listening-to-feedback-is-a-dangerous-half-truth aria-label="Why “Listening to Feedback” Is a Dangerous Half-Truth">Why “Listening to Feedback” Is a Dangerous Half-Truth</a></li><li><a href=#why-complexity-is-killing-your-adoption-rates aria-label="Why Complexity Is Killing Your Adoption Rates">Why Complexity Is Killing Your Adoption Rates</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-stop-building-smarter-models-and-start-solving-real-problems aria-label="How to Stop Building Smarter Models and Start Solving Real Problems">How to Stop Building Smarter Models and Start Solving Real Problems</a><ul><li><a href=#1-write-down-what-you-think-progress-looks-like aria-label="1.
