+++

_Your LLM prototype amazed everyone—until it didn't. Now it's stuck, and no one's using it. Here's why._

When most companies experiment with AI, **the go-to application is a chatbot**. It's intuitive, it looks impressive, and it feels like magic. But here's the cold, hard truth: **chatbots are why most LLM projects fail.**

I've seen it happen countless times. The team builds a chatbot to “harness AI,” and at first, it wows everyone. But then the cracks start to show:

- Users are frustrated. The chatbot gives incomplete answers or none at all.
- Adoption stalls. People revert to their old workflows.
- The project drags on, with no measurable impact.

Eventually, the chatbot gets shelved. The technology gets blamed. The lesson learned? _“AI isn't ready yet.”_

Wrong.

The problem isn't AI. The problem is that you've fallen into **the chatbot trap.**

Let's break down what's going wrong—and how to finally get your LLM project unstuck.

## **Why Most LLM Projects Fail After the Prototype**

### **1. You're Building a Tool, Not Solving a Problem**

Think about it: Why did your team decide to build a chatbot? Chances are, the conversation started with, _“We need to use AI,”_ instead of, _“What pain point are we solving?”_

Here's the truth: **users don't care about chatbots.** They care about results. They want outcomes that make their work easier, faster, or less frustrating.

Take this example:

- A consulting team is buried under a mountain of documents. They want to retrieve information faster.
- Someone suggests, _“Let's build a chatbot so they can ask questions and get answers!”_
- A prototype is built. It kind of works, but it's clunky. Users struggle to phrase questions correctly, and the answers aren't specific enough.
- After months of iteration, the chatbot fizzles out. Users move on. The team is back to square one.

What went wrong? No one stopped to ask, _“What outcome does the user actually want?”_

In this case, the consultants didn't want to chat—they wanted **structured, actionable insights.** Imagine if the AI automatically generated a report with key information upfront:

- No back-and-forth.
- No guessing how to phrase the question.
- Just the answers.

Suddenly, the AI is solving the real problem. And as a bonus, it's much simpler to build and measure.

### **2. Open Systems Create Chaos**

Chatbots let users ask anything. Sounds great, right? Until you realize the chaos it creates.

- What questions will users ask?
- How will they phrase them?
- What edge cases will they uncover?

This lack of constraints makes chatbots an **open system**—and open systems are a nightmare to measure or improve. How do you evaluate success when the scope is infinite?

You can't.

Compare that to a **closed system**, like generating a predefined report or extracting specific data. In a closed system:

- You know exactly what the output should be.
- You can measure accuracy, recall, and completeness.
- And because you can measure it, you can improve it.

Here's the rub: Chatbots feel magical, but from an engineering perspective, they're chaos.

### **3. Chatbots Set Users Up for Disappointment**

When you give someone a chatbot, you're promising: _“Ask me anything, and I'll give you the perfect answer.”_

But what happens when the chatbot responds with:

- _“I'm sorry, I don't understand that.”_
- _“I can't help with that.”_

Users get frustrated. Trust is destroyed.

Now imagine a **simpler, clearer solution**—a button labeled _“Generate Report”_ or a dashboard that delivers exactly what the user needs. Expectations are set upfront, and the experience feels seamless.

Here's the rule: **The simpler the solution, the clearer the expectations—and the better the user experience.**

## **How to Escape the Chatbot Trap**

If your LLM project is stuck, it's time to rethink your approach. The key? **Shift your mindset from “build something impressive” to “deliver outcomes that matter.”**

Here's how:

### **1. Start with the Problem**

Ask yourself:

- What pain point are we solving?
- What outcome does the user actually need?

If your answer starts with, _“We're building a chatbot,”_ stop. Chatbots are tools, not outcomes.

### **2. Constrain the Scope**

Avoid the temptation to build something that can “do it all.” Narrow your focus:

- What specific task will the AI handle?
- What won't it handle?

Smaller scope = less complexity = faster success.

### **3. Build Closed, Measurable Systems**

Focus on systems with clear boundaries:

- Automatically summarize documents.
- Generate predefined reports.
- Extract specific data.

Closed systems are:

- Easier to measure.
- Faster to improve.
- More likely to deliver value.

## **When Is a Chatbot the Right Solution?**

Let's be clear: Chatbots aren't useless. In **narrow, well-defined use cases**, they can work brilliantly. But those use cases are the exception, not the rule.

Before building a chatbot, ask:

- **What's the scope?** Can we define clear boundaries?
- **What's the expectation?** Will users understand its limitations?
- **What's the outcome?** Are we solving a real, measurable problem?

In most cases, a **simpler, structured solution** will deliver more value, faster.

## **The Bottom Line: Users Want Outcomes, Not Tools**

If your team is stuck in the chatbot trap, here's the harsh truth: **people don't care about your chatbot.** They care about getting the information they need—quickly, easily, and with zero friction.

So, instead of chasing flashy, complex tools:

- Deliver a report with exactly what they need.
- Build a dashboard that surfaces key insights in seconds.
- Focus on outcomes, not interfaces.

When you do this, two things happen:

1. **Users love it.** They trust the solution because it delivers value.
2. **You can measure success.** And if you can measure it, you can improve it.

AI doesn't need to feel magical to be valuable. The best AI solutions often feel simple—like they “just work.”
