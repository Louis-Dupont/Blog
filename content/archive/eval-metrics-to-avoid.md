title = 'DO NOT use these LLM Metrics â›” And what to do instead!'
+++

In two words: **Generalist LLM metrics are more of a danger than an opportunity.**

- **NEVER** start with them.
- Use them only as a **last resort**â€”and even then, with strict guidelines!

### So what are these vague, generic metrics?

- Helpfulness
- Conciseness
- Tone
- Personalisation
- â€¦ and more!

But what's so wrong with them?

## These Metrics Lack Real Meaning

The biggest problem? They're designed to evaluate an **LLM in general**, not a **specific use case**.

By definition, they apply broadlyâ€”but do they truly matter? More often than not, they have **weak correlations with user satisfaction** and even **weaker ties to actual ROI**.

And what do they really measure?

- **Conciseness?** What does "concise" even mean? It depends on your use case - and **your** definition.
- **Helpfulness?** How do you objectively assess that?

At best, these metrics provide vague direction. At worst, they **create the illusion that we're measuring something meaningful** -when we're not.

## Start with the Problem, Not the Solution

In the startup world, everyone preaches this - but few apply it when developing AI.

**Every metric should start with a strong "why."** The best way to get this right?

Let real-world failures guide you to the right metrics - **not the other way around.**
