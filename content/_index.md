# Building an AI prototype is easy - making it truly robust is hard.

If you have an LLM-based system that “kinda works” but keeps breaking every time you tweak it, I can help you install a clear, scientific iteration process.

- **No more random guesswork** or hoping that a new model magically fixes everything.
- **No more** “we’ll see if it’s better in production.”
- **Yes** to a reliable loop that shows exactly which changes help (and which do harm).

## My Process

1. **Diagnose Bottlenecks**  
   Quickly see why your iteration feels random. We uncover the real roadblocks, whether it’s unclear metrics or a lack of structured tests.

2. **Set Up Systematic Evaluation**  
   No more “It feels better.” We create clear metrics, checks, and error analyses so you know exactly when your AI improves.

3. **Prioritize the Right Fixes**  
   Focus on the issues that actually move the needle, saving you time and frustration.

4. **Validate Actual Improvements**  
   Every update is tested against robust criteria—no more guesswork or hidden regressions.

5. **Empower Your Team**  
   I’m not here to stay forever. I teach your team the method so you can keep iterating confidently on your own.

## Work With Me

If your AI prototype is **stuck**, I can help you turn it into a **scalable, production-ready system**.
