I've been building AI for years.

It's hard to admit, but many projects failed because I wasted months tweaking models and architectures, chasing improvements that never came.

Soon, **AI development felt more like gambling** than engineering.  
_And I'm not a good gambler._

I eventually realized I was focusing on the wrong thing:

**The main driver of AI development is not your creativity or ability to build complex systems.**  
It's your ability to **systematically learn**, from each experiment, what really matters to your users—and how to act on it.

It took me years to figure out how to systematically escape this loop.
