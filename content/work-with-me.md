If you’re building with LLMs, you probably know the pattern.

At first, things move fast. You get something working, hook up a few components, and it’s already good enough to demo. Maybe even ship.

But then the changes stop making sense.  
→ Some updates feel better. Some don’t.  
→ There’s no clear feedback loop.  
→ No grounded way to know what’s actually improving.  
→ Just intuition, vibes, and a lot of internal debate.

You keep tweaking, but you're not sure if you're moving forward.

**That’s where a lot of teams get stuck**. And stay stuck.
