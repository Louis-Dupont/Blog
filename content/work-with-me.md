AI teams don’t struggle to build models. They struggle to improve them.

If you’ve spent months tweaking models, trying new prompts, or optimizing pipelines—without really knowing if things are getting better—you’re not alone.

Most teams improve AI like they’re flying blind. They have intuition, they have talent, but they don’t have a structured way to know if an improvement is actually an improvement.

That’s what I help teams fix.

## **How Do We Move Forward?**

AI doesn’t improve just because you work harder on it. It improves when you know exactly where progress is blocked, and exactly how to move forward.

This can be divided into 3 main aspects.

**→ Clarity before action.**

Most AI teams jump straight into tweaking things—models, prompts, architectures—without a clear view of whether they’re solving the right problem. We start by breaking through the noise and getting to the core issue.

**→ A structured way to improve.**

AI development isn’t like software development—it’s iterative and unpredictable. I help teams put the right feedback loops in place so progress isn’t just _happening_—it’s controlled, measurable, and systematic.

**→ Progress that compounds.**

Most improvements fix one thing but break something else. We work together to make sure every iteration builds on the last, creating **real, lasting improvement**—not just another experiment.

I dig deeper into what this means in **real-world AI systems** in my [**blog**](./articles/). Feel free to check it out.

If you’d like to chat about how to help your team **systematically improve AI**, I run a [**free office hour**](./link-to-office-hour-registration) once a week.

For teams that want direct guidance, I also offer [**hands-on collaboration**](<(mailto:louis-dupont@live.fr)>) throughout this process.
