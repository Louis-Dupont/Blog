AI teams don't struggle to build models. They struggle to make them better.

If you're developping an AI feature you've probably felt this yourself. At first, it's easy to tweak models, adjust prompts, or optimize pipelines. But after a while, it becomes hard to tell if those changes are actually helping... or if you're just moving in circles.

The truth is, **improving AI** isn't about doing more. It's about **knowing exactly what's holding you back**, then **acting on it with confidence**.

That's exactly where I help.

I guide AI teams from guessing and uncertainty toward a structured, systematic approach, where each improvement is clear, measurable, and genuinely moves the needle.

_**Here's how it usually goes**_

**→ Diagnose First**  
Before rushing into improvements, we slow down and clearly understand what's blocking progress. This clarity means your team can stop chasing random improvements and start fixing the problems that actually matter.

**→ Run Structured Experiments**  
AI development isn't linear—it's iterative. We set up deliberate feedback loops so that every step forward is clear, measurable, and repeatable. No more guessing; just clear, validated progress.

**→ Build Lasting Progress**  
Changes that improve one thing but break another should stop. We'll focus on improvements that genuinely compound, leaving your AI reliably better off after every iteration.

If you're feeling stuck, there are a few _**simple ways to get started**_

- If you're still exploring, start by diving into my [**blog**](../articles/). I regularly share insights and frameworks you can apply right away.

- If you're facing specific challenges, I reserve limited time each week for a free office hour—one team per week. You can [**request a spot here**](https://form.typeform.com/to/VQqJ2ZDT).

- And if you're ready for direct, hands-on collaboration, feel free to [**reach out directly**](mailto:louis-dupont@live.fr). My minimum engagement starts at $2,500. If that's outside your budget, the weekly office hour is a great alternative.
