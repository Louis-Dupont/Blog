AI teams don't struggle to build models. They struggle to improve them.

It's easy to tweak models, adjust prompts, optimize pipelines. But after a while, it stops being clear whether those changes are actually helping.

AI doesn't improve simply by doing more. It improves when you have clarity—when you **know exactly what's limiting progress**, and exactly how to move forward.

That's what I do.

### Should you work with me?

I help teams move **from guessing to a structured, systematic way of improving AI**—one where every iteration is clear, measurable, and actually moves the needle.

The specifics depend on your situation, but it usually comes down to three simple but critical insights.

**→ Clarity first**  
_Most teams chase visible improvements without knowing if they're fixing the real issue. We slow down to first clearly diagnose what's truly blocking progress._

**→ Structured experimentation**  
_AI improvement isn't linear. You need deliberate, measurable feedback loops so each step forward is clear, repeatable, and proven._

**→ Real, lasting progress**  
_Changes that fix one thing but break another aren't improvements—they're just movement. We build improvements that genuinely compound, leaving you reliably better off after each step._

> _So, what's next?_

→ First, check out my [**blog**](./articles/)—I regularly share insights and mental models that can immediately help your team.

→ If you're working on AI and feel stuck, I set aside limited time for a free office hours—one team per week. You're welcome to [**request a spot**](https://form.typeform.com/to/VQqJ2ZDT).

→ For teams ready to dive deeper, I also offer direct, [**hands-on collaboration**](mailto:louis-dupont@live.fr).  
My minimum level of engagement starts at $5,500. If this is outside your budget, the weekly office hour is a great alternative.
