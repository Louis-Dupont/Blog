At first, iteration is fast. Each tweak makes a visible difference. But then, they hit a plateau.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Changes don’t seem to make a clear impact anymore&lt;/strong>. Some changes even backfire. The AI isn&amp;rsquo;t broken, but it’s no longer clear what to fix—or even how to tell if it’s improving at all.&lt;/p>

The company had unique customer data and believed AI could transform it into a highly personalized, valuable chatbot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We built a prototype fast. Our users were excited about the first demo.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-first-big-mistake">Our First Big Mistake&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>But there was a catch: we had almost no access to real users. With so few user tests, we had to rely on ourselves—we became our own test users.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
