Now it’s stuck, and no one’s using it. Here’s why.\nWhen most companies experiment with AI, the go-to application is a chatbot. It’s intuitive, it looks impressive, and it feels like magic. But here’s the cold, hard truth: chatbots are why most LLM projects fail.\nI’ve seen it happen countless times. The team builds a chatbot to “harness AI,” and at first, it wows everyone. But then the cracks start to show:\nUsers are frustrated. The chatbot gives incomplete answers or none at all. Adoption stalls. People revert to their old workflows. The project drags on, with no measurable impact. Eventually, the chatbot gets shelved. The technology gets blamed. The lesson learned? “AI isn’t ready yet.”\nWrong.\nThe problem isn’t AI. The problem is that you’ve fallen into the chatbot trap.\nLet’s break down what’s going wrong—and how to finally get your LLM project unstuck.\nWhy Most LLM Projects Fail After the Prototype 1. You’re Building a Tool, Not Solving a Problem Think about it: Why did your team decide to build a chatbot? Chances are, the conversation started with, “We need to use AI,” instead of, “What pain point are we solving?”\nHere’s the truth: users don’t care about chatbots. They care about results. They want outcomes that make their work easier, faster, or less frustrating.\nTake this example:\nA consulting team is buried under a mountain of documents. They want to retrieve information faster. Someone suggests, “Let’s build a chatbot so they can ask questions and get answers!” A prototype is built. It kind of works, but it’s clunky. Users struggle to phrase questions correctly, and the answers aren’t specific enough. After months of iteration, the chatbot fizzles out. Users move on. The team is back to square one. What went wrong? No one stopped to ask, “What outcome does the user actually want?”\nIn this case, the consultants didn’t want to chat—they wanted structured, actionable insights. Imagine if the AI automatically generated a report with key information upfront:\nNo back-and-forth. No guessing how to phrase the question. Just the answers. Suddenly, the AI is solving the real problem. And as a bonus, it’s much simpler to build and measure.\n2. Open Systems Create Chaos Chatbots let users ask anything. Sounds great, right? Until you realize the chaos it creates.\nWhat questions will users ask? How will they phrase them? What edge cases will they uncover? This lack of constraints makes chatbots an open system—and open systems are a nightmare to measure or improve. How do you evaluate success when the scope is infinite?\nYou can’t.\nCompare that to a closed system, like generating a predefined report or extracting specific data. In a closed system:\nYou know exactly what the output should be. You can measure accuracy, recall, and completeness. And because you can measure it, you can improve it. Here’s the rub: Chatbots feel magical, but from an engineering perspective, they’re chaos.\n3. Chatbots Set Users Up for Disappointment When you give someone a chatbot, you’re promising: “Ask me anything, and I’ll give you the perfect answer.”\nBut what happens when the chatbot responds with:\n“I’m sorry, I don’t understand that.” “I can’t help with that.” Users get frustrated. Trust is destroyed.\nNow imagine a simpler, clearer solution—a button labeled “Generate Report” or a dashboard that delivers exactly what the user needs. Expectations are set upfront, and the experience feels seamless.\nHere’s the rule: The simpler the solution, the clearer the expectations—and the better the user experience.\nHow to Escape the Chatbot Trap If your LLM project is stuck, it’s time to rethink your approach. The key? Shift your mindset from “build something impressive” to “deliver outcomes that matter.”\nHere’s how:\n1. Start with the Problem Ask yourself:\nWhat pain point are we solving? What outcome does the user actually need? If your answer starts with, “We’re building a chatbot,” stop. Chatbots are tools, not outcomes.\n2. Constrain the Scope Avoid the temptation to build something that can “do it all.” Narrow your focus:\nWhat specific task will the AI handle? What won’t it handle? Smaller scope = less complexity = faster success.\n3. Build Closed, Measurable Systems Focus on systems with clear boundaries:\nAutomatically summarize documents. Generate predefined reports. Extract specific data. Closed systems are:\nEasier to measure. Faster to improve. More likely to deliver value. When Is a Chatbot the Right Solution? Let’s be clear: Chatbots aren’t useless. In narrow, well-defined use cases, they can work brilliantly. But those use cases are the exception, not the rule.\nBefore building a chatbot, ask:\nWhat’s the scope? Can we define clear boundaries? What’s the expectation? Will users understand its limitations? What’s the outcome? Are we solving a real, measurable problem? In most cases, a simpler, structured solution will deliver more value, faster.\nThe Bottom Line: Users Want Outcomes, Not Tools If your team is stuck in the chatbot trap, here’s the harsh truth: people don’t care about your chatbot. They care about getting the information they need—quickly, easily, and with zero friction.\nSo, instead of chasing flashy, complex tools:\nDeliver a report with exactly what they need. Build a dashboard that surfaces key insights in seconds. Focus on outcomes, not interfaces. When you do this, two things happen:\nUsers love it. They trust the solution because it delivers value. You can measure success. And if you can measure it, you can improve it. AI doesn’t need to feel magical to be valuable. The best AI solutions often feel simple—like they “just work.”\nIf your LLM is stuck in the chatbot trap, let’s get it back on track. I’ve helped teams rethink their AI strategy and deliver real, measurable results.
